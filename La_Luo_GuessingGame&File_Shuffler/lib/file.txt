Write file_shuffler program that: * prompts the user for a file name * reads that file * shuffles the lines * saves it to the file "{input_name}-shuffled.txt".

Hint: You could create a random number using the Random class, or you could use the shuffle method in Array.

The examples I've shown you have all automatically closed the file when done. It is important to close files when you are finished with them; this doesn't matter so much for reading (it is merely inefficient), but if you don't close a file you are writing to, then the whole output may not be written to disk, and you may lose data.
